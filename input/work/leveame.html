            <p>Leveame was an amazing project, started as a podcast that i made with good friends talking about videogames then we made a website to publish notes, at the end we were a complete team: Authors, editors, broadcasters, designers, PR, etc.</p>
            <p>We did "Radio Leveame" a space with live programs and interviews, we went to some events (Press :3) for reporting and others fun things</p>
            <p>The problem was the time, many of us were working or were studying, many latter, we don't know</p>
